    <h1>What is the True Color Personality Quiz</h1>
    <p>The "True Colors" personality quiz is a system that categorizes people into four distinct personality types, represented by colors: blue, green, gold, and orange, by asking questions about their behaviors and motivations, allowing individuals to understand their own personality traits and how they might interact with others based on their dominant color; essentially, it's a way to identify your primary personality style using color metaphors.</p>
